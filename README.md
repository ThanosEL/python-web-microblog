I built this microblog website using Flask, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS.
It allows users to submit posts with any content they wish, which are then displayed on the website in real time.
The project demonstrates a simple yet functional web application with a backend in Flask, a MongoDB database for storing posts, and a responsive user interface with HTML and CSS.
